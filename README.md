# NLP_Speech_to_Text

1. Install the Required Packages:
   - Install the `SpeechRecognition` package by running `pip install SpeechRecognition`.
   - If needed, install any additional packages based on the specific requirements.

2. Import the Required Packages:
   - Import the necessary packages at the beginning of the code. For example:
     ```python
     import speech_recognition as sr
     import re
     import json
     ```

3. Implement the `convert_audio_to_text` Function:
   - Write the code for the `convert_audio_to_text` function. This function should use the `speech_recognition` package to convert the audio file to text.
   - Ensure that the function takes an audio file path as input and returns the corresponding transcription as output.

4. Implement the `IntentRecognizer` Class:
   - Write the code for the `IntentRecognizer` class. This class should contain the logic for intent recognition and entity extraction based on the provided examples.

5. Implement the `preprocess` Function:
   - Write the code for the `preprocess` function, which is used for cleaning and preprocessing the transcriptions.

6. Implement the `generate_summary` Function:
   - Write the code for the `generate_summary` function. This function should generate the JSON output file with the required format.
   - Ensure that the function takes the transcription, entities, and intent as input and returns the JSON output as a string.

7. Perform the Speech-to-Text Conversion and Intent Recognition:
   - Load the audio file that needs to be transcribed.
   - Call the `convert_audio_to_text` function and pass the audio file path as an argument. Store the transcription in a variable.
   - Create an instance of the `IntentRecognizer` class.
   - Call the `predict` method of the `IntentRecognizer` instance and pass the transcription as an argument. Store the predicted intent and entities in variables.

8. Generate the Summary and Output JSON File:
   - Call the `generate_summary` function and pass the transcription, entities, and intent as arguments. Store the JSON output as a string.
   - Write the JSON output to a file using the `open` function and the "w" mode.
   - Save the output file with the desired name, such as "output.json".

9. Print or Handle the Output as Required:
   - If needed, print the transcription, predicted intent, entities, or any other relevant information.

10. Handle Errors and Exceptions:
    - Implement error handling and exception handling as per specific requirements.
